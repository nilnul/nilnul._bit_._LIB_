	/// by applying the axiomatic inference rules, we shall never cause contradiction. That is the effect (B in A so B) is an expression that is satisfiable.
	/// 
	/// to make axiomatic rules consistent (not cause contradiction), the natrual rules have to be included in axiomatic rules. In fact consistent implies "natural rules " is included. the axiomatic only added some "conditional truth", that is A->B, or simple C, which is not implied by any, but asserted true by presuptions
