	inference:
		 any tautology can, by abstraction, become a rule. by Abstraction, the rule must be expressed by higher-order symbols which are differenct from symbols of this decution.
		 NoteHere: some inference is not natural but of a special discipline/specialty/domain. for example in physicals, we can say if a mass's density >1, then it will sink in water; this is in no way deemable as true by just computing with bit operators, instead, it can only be observed when we get out of the studio and get to the physcial world and follow the physical rules embodied in repeatable experiment/phenomenon/recurrence.
