///Every map can be colored with 4 colors so that adjacent1 regions have different colors.
///
////Two regions are adjacent only when they share a boundary segment of positive length. They are not considered to be adjacent if their boundaries meet only at a few points.

////This proposition is true and is known as the “four-color theorem”. However, there have been many incorrect proofs, including one that stood for 10 years in the late 19th century before the mistake was found. An extremely laborious proof was finally found about 15 years ago by a Mathematician named Haaken who used a complex computer program to categorize maps as four-colorable; the program left a couple of thousand maps uncategorized, and these were checked by hand by Haaken and his assistants—including his 15-year-old daughter. There was a lot of de-bate about whether this was a legitimate proof: the argument was too big to be checked without a computer, and no one could guarantee that the computer calculated correctly, nor did anyone have the energy to recheck the four-colorings of thousands of maps that was done by hand. Finally,
////about five years ago, a humanly intelligible proof of the four color theorem was found (see http://www.math.gatech.edu/ thomas/FC/fourcolor.html).

	/// <remarks>
	/// Then Kurt G¨odel proved that no set of axioms can be both consistent and complete! This means that any set of consistent axioms (an absolute must) can not be complete; there will be true statements that can not be proven. For example, it might be that Goldbach’s conjecture is true, but there is no proof!
